Trim_UCE_reads_trimmomatic
This tutorial describes how to trim UCE reads using Trimmomatic.

In general, the Phyluce (https://phyluce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/purpose.html) package provides all the necessary tools to process Ultra-Conserved Element (UCE) data. However, in some specific cases, it may be useful to use the tools independently of the package.

This tutorial outlines the steps to trim reads and prepare them for downstream analyses. It is important to know that Phyluce uses the wrapper Illumiprocessor (https://phyluce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/purpose.html) to perform this crucial step. Here, we provide an alternative approach, also based on Trimmomatic (https://github.com/usadellab/Trimmomatic).

Good luck!
